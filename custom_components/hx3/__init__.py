# otherwise happen on every single failed attempt (including ones a retry
# a few seconds later quietly fixes). Entities instead check
# Hx3Data.is_available(), so a brief blip doesn't surface as Unavailable
# unless refreshes have actually been failing for this long. This is
# added on top of MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_UPDATES (not a replacement for it) --
# a successful refresh is only ever attempted that often, so the grace
# window has to cover that normal gap too, not just the retry time.
